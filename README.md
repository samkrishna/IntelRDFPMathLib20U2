# IntelRDFPMathLib20U2

This is a slightly-modified version of the [IntelÂ® Decimal Floating-Point Math Library](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/intel-decimal-floating-point-math-library.html#download).

The changes are as follows:

- A macOS-specific build script (**RUNOSX**) in the `LIBRARY` directory
- Another macOS-specific Makefile in `LIBRARY` (`macos-install.makefile`)
- A bugfix that was causing a SEGFAULT in another codebase

## OTHER DETAILS:

Please see the [README](https://github.com/samkrishna/IntelRDFPMathLib20U2/blob/main/README) for additional details.
